# 📘 Dart Concepts Learning App

A Flutter-based educational app designed to teach the core concepts of the **Dart programming language** in a clean and interactive way.  
The app organizes concepts into **tabs**, with each tab covering a specific topic such as basics, null safety, control flow, loops, functions, collections, and object-oriented programming (OOP).

- 📄 **Concept Sections** – Each section shows:
  - Example Dart code  
  - Short description  
  - Sample output/result  
- 🖋️ **Selectable Code Blocks** – Users can copy code directly from the app.  
- 🎨 **Clean UI Design** – Built with Flutter widgets and responsive layouts.  
- 🧑‍🏫 **Educational Purpose** – Helps beginners understand Dart step by step.
